# PokemonMatchup
C# Project

This is my project for the C# Code Louisville class. It was designed to take user input on what Pokemon your enemy is using and returns a list of types that are super effective against that Pokemon. This list will exclude a type if it is weak against one of your enemies two types (if it has two types).

It encorporates the following features:

  1) Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program - this is done in the main method.
  2) Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program - this is done in the pokedex.cs class.
  3) Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application.
